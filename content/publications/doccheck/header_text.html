<p class="normal-text">It probably doesn't need to be explained to anyone anymore that exercise may be the single most potent medical intervention ever known for the most of us.</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">But what it has in common with inflammation, which mechanisms make it so valuable for the body, and for which patients it is contraindicated, you can find out here. The inflammatory response is a complex process whose regulation involves, among other things, immunocompetent cells, antibodies, and inflammatory mediators.</p>
