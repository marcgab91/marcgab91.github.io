<h3>About the study</h3>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">The study “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01456-x" target="_blank">Wearable Data Reveals Distinct Characteristics of Individuals with Persistent Symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 Infection,</a>” by K. Ledebur, M. Wiedermann, C. Puta, S. Thurner, P. Klimek, and D. Brockmann, was published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/npjdigitalmed/" target="_blank">npj Digital Medicine</a> (doi: 10.1038/s41746-025-01456-x).</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">People who later experienced persistent shortness of breath or fatigue after a COVID infection were already taking significantly fewer steps per day and had a higher resting heart rate before contracting the virus, according to a CSH study published in npj Digital Medicine. This may indicate lower fitness levels or pre-existing conditions as potential risk factors.</p>
