<h3>Voluntary slow breathing (VSB)</h3>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">Voluntary slow breathing is a low-cost, low-tech technique used to support physical and mental health by influencing the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">Voluntary slow breathing is a technique where breathing is performed at a slower pace (around 6 cycles per minute, cpm). Spontaneous breathing is usually comprised between 12 and 20 cycles per minute in adults  and usually with a higher breathing amplitude. Voluntary slow breathing offers various health benefits, including optimizing the <strong>autonomic nervous system</strong>, enhancing <strong>cardiopulmonary</strong> and <strong>neuroendocrine functions</strong>, reducing <strong>anxiety</strong> and <strong>arousal</strong>, and promoting <strong>relaxation</strong> and <strong>resilience</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">A systematic review [1] and meta-analysis examined the effect of voluntary slow breathing on heart rate variability (HRV), specifically vagally-mediated HRV (vmHRV), which reflects parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity. The analysis included 223 studies and found that VSB increases vagal mediated HRV during breathing sessions, immediately after one session, and following multi-session interventions. These findings suggest VSB can be an effective prevention and adjunct treatment method with minimal adverse effects, benefiting a wide range of health outcomes.</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">Deep slow breathing (DSB) effectively reduces anxiety levels and increases vagal outflow in both young and older adults [2]. This enhanced parasympathetic activity may aid in emotional regulation and anxiety management as people age. DSB is suggested as a practical intervention for acute anxiety, particularly beneficial for older adults, and may help prevent the long-term health effects of anxiety. Additionally, higher heart rate variability (HRV) associated with DSB is linked to better cognitive performance and emotion regulation.</p>

<h3>Voluntary Slow-paced breathing instructions (VSPB)</h3>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">Voluntary Slow-paced breathing instructions is considered a particularly effective method for stimulating the parasympathetic part of the autonomous nervous system.</p>
<p class="normal-text" style="margin-top:8px;">Slow-paced breathing means slow breathing (approximately six breaths per minute). It has been shown that slow-paced breathing promotes the synchronization of breathing and heart rate (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The associated stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system predominantly induces a state of inner calm.</p>
<ul class="normal-text indented" style="margin-top:8px;">
    <li>Slow-paced breathing can be started with 4 counts of inhalation and exhalation (4/4).</li>
    <li>The goal should be to lengthen the exhalation to 6 counts (4/6).</li>
    <li>The following procedure is recommended: 1 minute of 4/4, followed by 1 minute of 4/5, and then 1 minute of 4/6.</li>
    <li>The total duration can be increased to approximately 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
